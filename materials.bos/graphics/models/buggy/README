buggy.blend : Blender model by Frank Loeffler (c) 2004
compose     : Bash script to compose the many output images into two
              images. It needs 'convert', contained in the
              imagemagic tools, and 'mmv', a small script to rename
              multiple files.
              In order to use this you have to save the images which
              should go into the shadow file as 'shadow????.png' where
              ???? are the numbers of the images and the images that
              should go into the unit file as 'normal????.png'.
              The model is ready for the shadow images. To obtain the
              unit images, remove the plane on which the model is sitting
              and change the output filename to 'normal' before rendering.

The model and the script are distributed unter the GPL (look below).

It is a model used for creating a unit of the game 'Battle of Survival'.

It is not needed for playing, it was/is just used for development purposes.
