buggy.blend : Blender model by Frank Loeffler (c) 2004
compose     : Bash script to compose the many output images into two
              images. It needs 'convert', contained in the
              imagemagic tools, and 'mmv', a small script to rename
              multiple files.

The model and the script are distributed unter the GPL (look below).

It is a model used for creating a unit of the game 'Battle of Survival'.

It is not needed for playing, it was/is just used for development purposes.
